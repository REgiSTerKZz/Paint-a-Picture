## Information

This is the idea of a possible exploration game in which the diferentiating element is the way we explore the world.

Each time the player make s a photo with the camera, the world appears and the players is available to explore.


## Game

To prove the game could work I implemented some basic `Grabb&Realese` mechanics so that the player could personalize the house in the world. 

## Controls

The controls are eazy but there is a tricky one that I thick its worth mentioning.

*   **Move**: WASD
*   **Take a photo**: Left-click of the mouse. The camera layout will appear.


*   **Return home**: Make a photo aiming at the sun.
